# Blazing Renderer (BRender), Croc version

This is the Croc Definitive Edition fork of BRender, originally the internal version
in the Croc source tree (later released [here](https://github.com/foone/BRender-1997)).

It has since been updated to include all the changes from the latest-known version,
[1.3.2](https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2).

Sample applications, (`robot` and `cube`) are included, as well as most of the original
utilities released with the engine.

Enjoy!
